# if elif else
Run a code block based on one or more _conditions_
```sh
if test condition
then
    echo "condition is true"
elif test other_condition
then
    echo "other_condition is true"
else
    echo "condition and other_condition is false"
fi
```

# Case
Run a code block depending on which pattern matches the value of a variable.
```sh
case var_to_test in
  value)
    echo "var_to_test equal 'value'"
    ;;
  value1 | value2)
    echo "var_to_test equal 'value1' or 'value2'"
    ;;
  *index.md)
    echo "var_to_test equal '*test' glob motif"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "var_to_test match nothing above"
    ;;
esac
```

# While (loop)
Repeatedly run a code block while the _condition_ is true.
```sh
# condition
while condition
do
  echo "execution block"
done
```
```sh
# lopping over command return
$(ls .) | while read line
do
  echo "Line: $line"
done
```
```sh
# looping over file content
while read line
do
  echo "Line: $line"
done < file.txt
```
# Until (loop)
Repeatedly run a code block until the condition is true.
```sh
until condition
do
  echo "execution block"
done
```

# for (loop)

```sh
# from static list
for item in a b c d
do
    echo "execution block"
done
```
```sh
# from glob motif
for file in *.txt
do
    echo "txt file: $file"
done
```
```sh
# from command
for user in $(ls .)
do
    echo "Hello $user"
done
```


# Loops Control
```shell
IFS=":" # redefined the char separator to ':' 
{while/until/for}
do
  continue # skip to the next interation 
  break    # exit the loop
done
```
